excerpt: 'It’s a pretty balanced market right now, but in most areas seller’s have a slight advantage.This time of year, inventory is typically quite low, so what we’re seeing now is pretty normal. You can expect to see more listings pop up in the early spring months.'

Today, we’re going to talk about **the importance of getting a home inspection.**

A lot of times when you look at a house, **you don’t know where to look for potential problems.** All you can see is the home’s decor. You need an inspector to come in and go through everything that you can’t see. They will examine things like the electrical system, plumbing, and the roof so you know exactly what you are getting into.

After the inspection, **you will receive a full report of any issues with the home.** If there is a problem the sellers didn’t initially disclose, you can sit down and negotiate who will be responsible for the repairs. You may even get a lower purchase price or allowance for repairs.

One thing you should pay attention to as a buyer is **the bones of the house.** These are things that you cannot change, like the floor plan, the view, and the location. You can redecorate your house every ten years or so to keep up with current trends, but you can’t really change the bones of the house.
